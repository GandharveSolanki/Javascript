A function expression is similar to a function declaration, with the difference that it can be stored in a variable. 

var temp=function solution(n){//this is named function expression as the function has a name ...
    var i=n;
    return i+1;    //here you can put a recursive statement like solution(n-1)
}

console.log(temp(5))
but the statement 
console.log(solution(6)) will give us error as you just cant use the function solution outside the variable so you can only call the function via the variable..

see if you do console.log(temp) it will give o.p as the function ..

var temp=function(n){//unnamed expression...
    var i=n;
    return i+1;    
}

console.log(temp(5))

//console.log(temp)//then if you see the o/p it will be a function but the name of the function will be temp as you have not given function any name....
