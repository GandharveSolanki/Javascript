javascript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page to interractive one .

javascript adds behavior to web pages javascript is a programming language used both on client side as well as server side that allows you to make web pages interactive .

html is standard markup language for creating the web pages html desribes the structure of a web page ..

css describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen paper or in other media .

in vs code create folder and in that folder create index.js file then to run it on terminal we use

var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable

You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.


//code 
console.log("hello");
var myName="Gandharve solanki";
console.log(myName);
console.log(typeof(myName));

//some outputs 
 console.log( 10 + "20"); output will be 1020 how just refer https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp
 
 see but there is a bug console.log( 9-"5");//the output will be 4 and this is a bug as 10+"20" is concatenating  but 9-"5" is not concatenating .. so no logic just a bug
 
 console.log("Java"+"script");
 console.log("Java "+"script");
 but console.log("Java "+        "script"); will prinh java script only if you want more spae just add that space between " "
 
 console.log("vinod"-"thapa"); give Nan which means not a number ..
 
 
  console.log(true+true);//the output will be 2.
  console.log(true+false);//the output will be 1.
  console.log(false+true);//the output will be 1.
  console.log(false-true);//the output will be -1.

javascript supports the below 6 data types ..
Boolean type
Null type
Undefined type
Number type
BigInt type
String type
Symbol type  
 
Differnce between null and undefined?
// var iAmUseless = null;
// console.log(iAmUseless); //so null will be the output ..
// console.log(typeof(iAmUseless));//data type will come out to be object but null isnt a object so this is another bug in the javascript..
// //2nd javascript bug

// var iAmStandBy;
// console.log(iAmStandBy);//it will show undefined and once you assign some value to this variable then that undefined goes 
// console.log(typeof(iAmStandBy));//data type will come out to be undefined 

What is Nan
In JavaScript, NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value which is not a valid number. It can be used to check whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number. 


// var myPhoneNumber = 9876543210;
// var myName = "thapa technical";

// console.log(isNaN(myPhoneNumber));
// console.log(isNaN(myName));

// if(isNaN(myName)){
//     console.log("plz enter valid phone no");
// }

To assign a variable to NaN value, we can use one of the two following ways.

var a = NaN
var a = Number.NaN
