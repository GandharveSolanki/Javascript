dom represents the logical structure of the web page you have (document object model)
so head ,html div all the elements are the part of the dom so we will be able to manipulate access all the elements using dom so javascript is able to do that using the
dom ..

see the structure of the dom   diagramatically it loooks like a tree you can see that online 

imp objects in the dom are window ,document ,screen
document.head, document.body try typing these on the console..

consider a html document and you have created two heading of h1 with one h1 id as one and another h1 heading id as two ..

so you can now play around in the console try doing 
var heading =document.getElementById("one");//id is unique so this returns a single value only 

heading.style.color="red";

heading.style.backgroundColor="cyan";

var headings=document.getElementsByTagName("h1");//this will fetch all the h1 headings 
if you want to check how many h1 heading do you have you can just type

headings in the console..
so i want to change the text of second h1 heading  
headings[1].innerText="second heading";//the second heading will be at index 1 ..

similarly you can access the elements by their class name ...
var temp=document.getElementsByClassName('para');//so again this will give us the array of elements which have class as para 
temp[0].style.backgroundColor="cyan";

you can also access the element by its css selector ..

var heading=document.querySelector('#one');

heading.innerHTML="hello";

//accessing element by using the css class selectors..
var heading=document.querySelector('.para');//there can be multiple paragraphs with the same class.. so document.querySelector('.para')//so this will return the first
matching result

//in case if we want all the matching results 
var para=document.querySelectorAll('.para');//so this will return an array

//event handling..


    <button id="btn">hello</button>
    lets say we have a button and if it is clicked we want something to happen so we can 
    use onclick attribute for this 
    
    <button id="btn" onclick="alert('hello')">hello</button>
    
    //alternate way of doing this ..
    on console.
    or in index.js
    var heading=document.getElementById('btn');
    now in heading we got our element now we can add event listener to this button 
    
    //click is the event i want to handle and second argument is the event handler is the action that needs to be performed if the event takes place so the handler
    will the function which will have the desired code ...so in the second argument you can write the function name or straight away create a function there .. and pass


heading.addEventListener('click',function(){ //add this in javascript  file if you want ..
    alert("hello");
});


//or function hello()
     {
     alert("hello");
     }
 heading.addEventListener('click',hello);
 //you can add more than one event handler as well.
 lets say 
 
 function byee()
 {
 alert("byee");
 }
 heading.addEventListener('click',byee);
 
 
 //mouse and keyboard events..
 
 there are many mouse events like click ,mouseover and mouseout  
 
 var outerDiv=document.getElementById("outer");
 outerDiv.addEventListener('mouseover',function(){ 
    console.log("mouseover");
});

 outerDiv.addEventListener('mouseout',function(){ 
    console.log("mouseout");
});

//suppose we have an input box with an id of search .. we can add keypress event to it..
var searchInput=document.getElementById("search");
 searchInput.addEventListener('keypress',function(){ 
    console.log("keypressed");
});

document.addEventListener('keypress',function(){//so now wherever you pressakey in the document you get keypressed written in the console...
console.log("keypressed");
});

//but the keypress does not detect up,down,left,right arrows and alt shift tab key etc so if you want to detect these things also so for that you can use the keydown
event ...

keypress is one keydown and up so basically if you write a character that is keypress now keydown is you pressed the key and keyup is after pressing key it comes up

so keypress ,keydown ,keyup these are all events and keydown will detect right left up down arrows as well 
 
 
 document.addEventListener('keydown',function(){
console.log("keydown");
});

//in case you want to detect which key is being pressed so for that 

document.addEventListener('keydown',function(event){//so your function should collect the event infact you can collect the event in case of click mouseover etc as well
console.log("keydown",event.keyCode);//which key has been pressed you can do that using event.keyCode 
});//event.keyCode will show us the ascii code value..

propagation  of event ..//this is a very important concept  //covered in your notes..
